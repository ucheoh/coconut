          While I looked for for a new job opportunity, she provided me with
          clear and actionable feedback on how to craft emails that get
          responses. When I did get an offer and reached the salary
          negotiation phase, she coached me through the process of getting the
          company to
          <span class="bold-copy">raise their initial offer by $10,000</span>.
          (Yes, you read that right!) All in all, I cannot recommend Stephanie
          enough - her guidance is truly invaluable and she's a wonderful
          person to have in your corner.

          Stephanie outlined priceless strategy that helped me connect with
          key decision makers and easily sway them to take me to the next step
          in the process. She was with me in every part of the process,
          outreach, interview and negotiation. That value filled my pipeline
          and
          <span class="bold-copy">got me interviews at 25% of the places I targeted</span>.

          I was really scared to counter-offer my first offer from a company I
          really wanted to work at. I told Stephanie, “I’m just going to take
          it.” She immediately, implored that I make a counter-offer and she
          made it really easy for me to demonstrate my market value back to my
          future employer. Because of this newly instilled confidence and
          advice,
          <span class="bold-copy">I countered the offer and received more stock options</span>
          for a company that recently went public. I’ve learned so much from
          Stephanie!

          While making a tough transition from a company I was at for nearly
          three years, Stephanie gave me practical, helpful guidance that both
          <span class="bold-copy">prepared me for a smooth transition out of my former role</span>
          and prepared me for entering the competitive Bay Area tech job
          market. I can't recommend her highly enough to anyone looking for
          outside help when it comes to all things Career growth!
